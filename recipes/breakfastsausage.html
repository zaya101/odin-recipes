    <p>Make the holiday morning breakfast extra special with this delicious breakfast sausage casserole. The entire casserole is assembled the night before, so all you'll need to do on Christmas morning is pop it in the oven (and it'll be done by the time everyone is finished opening their presents)!</p>
